\title{Extract sample-wise coefficients (alpha_i) from a fastsvm model}
\usage{
\method{coef}{fastsvm}(object, ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{object}{An object of class \code{"fastsvm"} returned by
\code{fastsvm()}.}

\item{...}{Additional arguments (unused; included for S3 compatibility).}
}
\value{
A numeric vector of length \code{n}, containing the sample-wise
  coefficients \code{alpha_i}.
}
\description{
This method returns the vector of coefficients \code{coef_} estimated by
\code{sksurv.svm.FastKernelSurvivalSVM}. Each coefficient corresponds to
the weight assigned to an individual training sample in the kernel-induced
decision function.
}
\details{
These coefficients play the same role as support vector weights in
classical SVMs: samples with non-zero coefficients (within a tolerance)
can be interpreted as "support-like" vectors.
